    A touchpad configuration and management application.

    Touchpad access
    ---------------

    The :mod:`~synaptiks.touchpad` module provides the
    :class:`~touchpad.Touchpad` class to access and configured the touchpad.
    This class uses the XInput API provided by Xorg to access the properties of
    the touchpad driver.  This API is wrapped in a pythonic interface by the
    :mod:`~synaptiks.xinput` module.
