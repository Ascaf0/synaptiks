    A touchpad configuration and management application.

    Touchpad access
    ---------------

    The :mod:`~synaptiks.touchpad` module provides the
    :class:`~touchpad.Touchpad` class to access and configured the touchpad.
    This class uses the XInput API provided by Xorg to access the properties of
    the touchpad driver.  This API is wrapped in a pythonic interface by the
    :mod:`~synaptiks.xinput` module.

    Event monitoring
    ----------------

    The :mod:`~synaptiks.monitors` module provides monitor classes, which
    listen for external events.  These monitors are used by **synaptiks** to do
    automatic touchpad management.  Currently it includes classes for mouse
    device and keyboard monitoring.

    Touchpad management
    -------------------

    Atop of :mod:`~synaptiks.touchpad` and :mod:`~synaptiks.monitors` the
    :mod:`~synaptiks.management` module implements a sophisticated automatic
    touchpad management, which enables and disables the touchpad based on
    external events like keyboard activity and plugged mouse devices, which is
    a core feature of **synaptiks**.

    Configuration
    -------------

    **synaptiks** allows to configure both the touchpad and the touchpad
    manager.  The corresponding configuration classes
    :class:`~synaptiks.config.TouchpadConfiguration` and
    :class:`~synaptiks.config.ManagerConfiguration` as well as some
    configuration utilities are provided by :mod:`~synaptiks.config`.
